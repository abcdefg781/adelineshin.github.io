My name is Adeline Shin and I am currently working at Humana in Boston, MA as a Data Scientist. I recently completed my MS in Biostatistics at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in the Theory and Methods track. Previously, I was at Carnegie Mellon University, where I graduated with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering, as well as a minor in Drama.

I am passionate about finding creative solutions that can improve health outcomes for everyone, and not just the average individual. My interests lie at the intersection of Health Data Science, Biomedical Engineering, and Precision Medicine. Particularly, I am interested in how we can measure social determinants of health on an individual level and implement ways to help disadvantaged groups.

In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, running, seeing theatre, and watching Formula One races. You can check out some of my previous projects and work in the other tabs.

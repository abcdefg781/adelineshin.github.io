My name is Adeline Shin and I am currently a Senior Data Scientist within Clinical Analytics at Humana. I am passionate about the intersection of healthcare and data science and using my skills to improve healthcare outcomes.

During my time at Humana, I have led the analytics for several pilot programs for polychronic care management and health-related social needs. These programs improve member outcomes while reducing medical costs, and as a lead analyst on these projects, I have developed frameworks for evaluating vendors that we would potentially partner with. Through my work, I have extensive experience working with member, claims and payment data, and I have evaluated programs through causal inference methods such as RCTs and DiDs.

Prior to this, I completed my MS in Biostatistics at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in the Theory and Methods track. I also received my BS in Biomedical and Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, with a minor in drama. My interests lie at the intersection of Health Data Science, Biomedical Engineering, and Precision Medicine. Particularly, I am interested in how we can measure social determinants of health on an individual level and implement ways to help disadvantaged groups.

In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, mountain biking, theatre, running, skiing, watching Formula One races, and just spending time with my cat. I am always looking for ways to use my data science skills in my hobbies as well. You can check out some of my projects and work in the other tabs.

My name is Adeline Shin and I am a first year M.S. Biostatistics student at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. I graduated in May from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering, as well as a minor in Drama.

I am passionate about improving health outcomes for everyone, and not just the average individual. My interests lie at the intersection of Health Data Science, Biomedical Engineering, and Precision Medicine. With the technology we have in smartphones, watches, and other wearable health and fitness devices, I believe we can harness that data to improve healthcare. 

You can check out some of my previous projects and work in the other tabs.
